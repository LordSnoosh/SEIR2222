# Deploying a Node/Express App to Heroku

## Intro

Project 1 was a static application that required no code to run on a server.  However, SEI's Project 2 and beyond are full-stack web applications that need to run code on a backend server.

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) is an extremely popular hosting service capable of hosting a variety of web development stacks including Node/Express, Ruby/Rails, Python/Django, and many more.

Deploying a Node/Express app to Heroku is straightforward. Just follow the steps below...

## 1. Express App Prerequisites

### PORT Number

Hosting services determine what port a Node application will listen for HTTP requests on.

Hosting services set a Node environment variable, `process.env.PORT`, that our application needs to listen on during production (not development).

If your Express application was generated using express-generator, you're all set thanks to this line of code in the `www` file:

```js
var port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '3000');
```

However, if you created your Express app "from scratch", then you need to ensure that the app listens on `process.env.PORT` if it's deployed.

### Node Version

Specifying a Node version in the `package.json` is **not** necessary.

### Specifying a Start Script

Again, you're already set if you generated your app using express-generator.

Otherwise, here's the [link](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs#specifying-a-start-script).

## 2. Open a Free Account on Heroku

Browse to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to open a free account.

Providing a credit card is not required. However, if you "verify" your account using a credit card, you get 1000 free dyno hours instead of 550, 100 free apps instead of 5, and the ability to use your own custom domains.

## 3. Install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI)

### Installation

The Heroku CLI makes it easy to create and manage apps in your Heroku account.

Click [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install) to find the links to download and install it for your operating system.

### Log In

Once the Heroku CLI is installed, type `heroku login` anywhere in terminal and follow the instructions to log in using your Heroku account's credentials.


## Deploy the App!

#### IMPORTANT

> If you haven't already done so, please ensure that you are in your project folder from this point forward.

### Create the App in your Heroku Dashboard

Your [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) lists all of your apps that have been deployed to Heroku.

Before you can deploy a new app, you must first create the app and using the CLI is the easiest approach:

```
$ heroku create <optional preferred name of app>
```

If you don't specify the `<optional preferred name of app>` argument, Heroku will assign a randomly generated app name automatically.

Keep in mind that there are thousands upon thousands of apps deployed on Heroku, so you may have to get creative when giving your app a name because it has to be unique to Heroku. Using hyphens is one way to help get the app name/URL you want.

For example, this is the command used to create _mongoose-movies_ app:

```
$ heroku create mongoose-movies
```

The output from the above command was:

```
Creating â¬¢ mongoose-movies... done
https://mongoose-movies.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/mongoose-movies.git
```

Verify the command was successful by verifying that a git remote named `heroku` was created by typing:

```
$ git remote -v
```

You should see a remote name `heroku` listed, if it wasn't, try `heroku create` again with another name.

### Ensure the Code is Committed to `master`

Deploying to Heroku is as easy as pushing the `master` branch to the remote named `heroku`.

First, make sure your code is committed (on the `master` branch):

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku"
```

Then push the repo to Heroku:

```
$ git push heroku master
```

The above command will kick off the deployment on Heroku which may take a minute or two to complete.

While the app is deploying, you will see messages from the Heroku server prefaced by `remote: `.

A successful deployments will have a

`remote: -----> Build succeeded!`

message and ultimately a

`remote: Verifying deploy... done.`

toward the bottom of the output.

If the deployment fails, there will be error messages that can be used to track down the issue(s).

### Set the App's Environment Variables

Each of the key:value pairs in your app's `.env` file must be set on Heroku using the following command:

```
$ heroku config:set KEY=VALUE
```

For example: 

```
$ heroku config:set DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://username:pw@cluster0-oxnsb.azure.mongodb.net/mongoose-movies?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Multiple key:value pairs can be space separated, or the command can be run as many times as necessary.

> Note:  If using zsh, it may be necessary to quote the KEY=VALUE pair, for example:<br>`heroku config:set "DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://username:pw@cluster0-oxnsb.azure.mongodb.net/mongoose-movies?retryWrites=true&w=majority"`

**IMPORTANT**

For deployments using OAuth, be sure to use your Heroku app's hostname, **not** `localhost:3000` when setting the callbacks URL.  For example, this was the command used to set the Google OAuth callback for _mongoose-movies_:

```
$ heroku config:set GOOGLE_CALLBACK=https://mongoose-movies.herokuapp.com/oauth2callback
```

### Update the App's Google OAuth Registration

As discussed in the OAuth lesson, the time would come after deployment that we would need to update the app's **Authorized redirect URIs**  in the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com) for the project.

Ensure that the correct project is selected in the dropdown:

Click the project's **Credentials** menu choice on the left, then click the name listed in the **OAuth 2.o Client IDs**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dp91TAD.png"> 

Now click the **+ ADD URI** button that's below **Authorized redirect URIs**:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FGApdkD.png">

Finally, enter the exact URI that you assigned to the GOOGLE_CALLBACK environment variable and click the **SAVE** button:

### Browse to the App

Okay, now the big moment, browse to your deployed app, e.g., https://mongoose-movies.herokuapp.com and test it out!

You can also enter the following command in terminal to open the browser to the app:

```
$ heroku open
```

### Congrats on deploying to Heroku!

## Troubleshooting

Deployment messages, error messages, as well as the output you typically see in your terminal when running your app during development (including output from your code's `console.log` statements) can be viewed using the following command:

```
$ heroku logs
```

Since the proper setting of environment variables is a common source of problems, use the following command to log out the list of variables set on Heroku:

```
$ heroku config
```
