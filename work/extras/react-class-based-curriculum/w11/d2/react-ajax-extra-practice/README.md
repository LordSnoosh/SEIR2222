- For you homework you are going to build an application of your choice. 
- You may use the following API's,
1. [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started)
2. [Pokemon Api](https://pokeapi.co/)
3. [weather api](https://openweathermap.org/api)

#### Deliverables
1.  Inside of your main container component you will render at least three properties from your API.
2.  Style your app with whatever you like, you may try semantic-ui-react. (installation instructions below)
3.  Use React Router, to simulate user login functionality in which when you land on the app (the form could just take the name of the user), you see a login component, and then it switches to your main container component after you are logged in, and you leave a message in the main container greetng the user by there name 

#### To install semantic-ui-react
1.  `npm install semantic-ui-css`
2.  `npm install semantic-ui-react`
3.  Inside of `index.js`above, your `index.css`, `import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css';`

Then you should be good to go!

Bonus: 
 1. Try To create an animation when you switch between components
 2.  Try to complete a logout functionality that switches back the login component
