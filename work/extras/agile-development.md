# User Stories

---
### User Stories - _What are they?_
<br>

- Key component of the initial planning for an Agile project

- Defines small chunks of _business value_ which can be implemented in a period of days to weeks

- Captures what a user does or needs 

- Commonly formulated by questioning the customer/user

- Often initially written on 3x5 index cards

- NOT a programming To-Do List

---
### User Story Template
<br><br>

#### _As a {user type (role)}, I want {feature} so that {reason}._

>#### As an administrator, I want to approve photos before they are posted so that I can make sure they are appropriate.

---
## Using Trello for Agile<br>Setup
<br>

  - __Ice Box__ (aka _Backlog_)
  - __Current__ (aka _Planned_)
  - __Sprint__ (aka _In Progress_)
  - __Done__

---
## Using Trello for Agile<br>Setup
<br>

- Due to time limitations, you can organize your lists as:
  - __Ice Box__
  - __MVP__ (aka _Planned_)
  - __Done__
 
---
## Using Trello for Agile<br>User Stories
<br>

- Each _User Story_ will be a Trello _Card_

- The _User Story_ cards can contain:
  - The details for the Story in the _Description_ section
  - Optional: You can document the Point value assigned to complete the story in parenthesis after the _Title_.
  - Use the _Checklist_ to track tasks or steps necessary to complete the story. When creating a checklist, you are given the opportunity to name it.

---
## Using Trello for Agile - Flow

- __Ice Box__: Put all of your ideas in here to start. Feel free to put in large features (epics) in here until they are broken down into user stories.

- __Current__: Stories that make the cut are put here. You may choose to prioritize your stories from top to bottom. This is also a good place to put cards for bugs to be fixed.

- __Sprint__: This list holds the user stories and bugs currently being developed.

- __Done__: Done obviously holds the completed stories.
