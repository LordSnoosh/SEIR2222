### 1. Intro to Cascading Style Sheets

#### What is CSS?

CSS is a web technology used to format and style HTML documents. With the advent of CSS3, CSS can also provide some stylistic behaviors using CSS animations.

CSS enables us to separate the structure & content (HTML) of a document from its presentation.  This concept of *separation of concerns* is widespread throughout software development because it helps make programs more maintainable and provides better code reuse.

Like most skills related to development, your CSS skills will continually develop over time with each front-end project you're involved with.

#### Basic CSS Syntax

The following graphic shows the basic syntax of a CSS rule:

![](https://i.imgur.com/IoBhwOi.gif)

Let's discuss the individual components above:

- **Selectors**:
	- Used to target the element(s) to be styled.
	- Can range from simple to complex.
	- Multiple selectors are separated with commas.
- **Properties**:
	- There are over two hundred CSS properties that can be used to style the color, size, text, position, border, animation, etc. of elements.
- **Value**:
	- The value to apply to a property is, of course, specific to that property. For example, the CSS property, _font-family_, accepts values of names of fonts such as _Georgia_, _Helvetica_, etc. Other properties may have numeric values along with a type of unit assigned to them, for example, you might set the width of a border to _5px_.
- **Declaration**:
	- The combination of a _property_ and _value_, separated by a colon and ending with a semi-color, makes a _declaration_.

### 2. CSS Properties

#### Basic Properties

We are going to take 5 minutes to research CSS Properties, so visit any of the following references and learn more about any 2 properties of your choosing:

- [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/) - top listing if you google "css properties".
- [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/) - one of the best sites for all things CSS
- [CSS Properties - HTML Dog](http://www.htmldog.com/references/css/properties/)
- [codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/#section_css-property) 
- [CSS3 cheat sheet](https://www.kobzarev.com/wp-content/uploads/cheatsheets/css/css3-cheat-sheet.pdf)

Be prepared to answer these questions about the properties you have chosen:

- What does that property do? (usually obvious thanks to logical naming)
- What are some of the values that can be applied to the property?

#### Shorthand Properties

Shorthand properties are CSS properties that let you set the values of several CSS properties simultaneously.
   
Using a shorthand property, a web developer can write more concise CSS.
  
A shorthand property groups properties of a common theme.  Here are some examples:

##### font
  
```css
p {
   font-style: italic;
   font-weight: bold;
   font-size: 12px;
   line-height: 14px;
   font-family: Helvetica;
}
```

The five lines of CSS declarations above can be merged into a single declaration as follows:

```css
p {
   font: italic bold 12px/14px Helvetica;
}
```

##### margin
  
```css
div {
   margin-top: 10px;
   margin-right: 5px;
   margin-bottom: 15px;
   margin-left: 25px;
}
```

The four lines of CSS declarations above can be merged into a single declaration as follows:
  
```css
div {
   margin: 10px 5px 15px 25px;
}
```
   
The above `margin` example specifies margins for all four sides (top, right, bottom & left - in that order).

A good word to help remember the ordering of these values is **TR**ou**BL**e (top-right-bottom-left).
   
[This documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) explains all about shorthand properties.

### 3. Adding Styles to a Web Page

#### Setup

Before we can add styles to a web page, we're going to need one to style!

In Terminal (don't type the `$`):

```
$ mkdir css-basics
$ cd css-basics
$ touch index.html
$ code .
```

Now let's add the boilerplate HTML to `index.html`.

VS Code already has a utility, _Emmet_, that allows us to just type `!`, followed by `[tab]`, to insert the HTML boilerplate:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>SEI Rocks!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

With our boilerplate in place, let's check it out in the browser, however, the default install of VS Code does not allow us to open an HTML file we're editing in a browser :(

Let's install an extension to fix this issue.  Press `[shift]-[cmd]-X` to open the extensions panel. Type `open in browser` in the search box and install something like "open in browser". After installation, click `Reload` then you should be able to right-click on the file in the editor and select _Open in Default Browser_.

BTW, `[shift]-[cmd]-E` returns to the folder/file explorer in the side bar.

#### Three Ways to Add Styles

There are three ways to add styling to a web page:

  1. Inline Styles
  2. Internal Stylesheets
  3. External Stylesheets

These three techniques are not mutually exclusive, you can use one or more of them in the same webpage.

##### 1. Inline Styles

An **inline style** can be used to apply style to a single element using the `style` attribute.

The use of inline styles breaks our separation of concerns by mixing content with presentation, therefore avoid using this technique unless there's a good reason to do so, for example, when testing or debugging styles.

> Note: Several JS libraries and frameworks such as _AngularJS_ add inline styles dynamically to perform their magic. _ReactJS_ even encourages the use of inline styling "components" dynamically. However, in general, developers rarely use inline styling for their application's CSS.

To demonstrate inline styling, let's use it to change the color of the  background and font:

```html
<body style="background-color: #eedd8e; color: darkblue">
``` 

Above we have used both a "[named color](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp)" as well as a RGB hex value. There's a link in the References section if you want to learn more about colors in CSS.

Save and refresh - bingo!

##### 2. Internal Stylesheet

The second of the three techniques we can use to add CSS is with **internal stylesheets**.

An **internal stylesheet** is created by using a `<style>` element nested within the document's `<head>` element:

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>CSS Basics</title>
  <!-- inline stylesheet -->
  <style>
    h1 {
      text-align: center;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

Now the text within our `<h1>` will be centered!

Although an improvement over using inline styling, inline stylesheets are also not the preferred method to add styles to your web page. However, they can be handy for quick styling - like we might do during a lesson :)

##### 3. External Stylesheets

The last of the three techniques available to add styling is **external stylesheets**.

Styling a page using **external stylesheets** is considered a best practice because it provides the best separation of concerns, reusability and maintainability.

External stylesheets are separate files with a `.css` extension and are "linked" to the document using the `<link>` element.

First, let's create our stylesheet inside of a new `css` folder:

```
$ mkdir css
$ touch css/styles.css
```

Now we can link in the `styles.css` external stylesheet like this:

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>CSS Basics</title>
  <style>
    h1 {
      text-align: center;
    }
  </style>
  <!-- bring in an external stylesheet -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
</head>
```

> Note that the `href` path in this case is relative to **index.html**. Also, the `rel` attribute stands for "relationship". 
     
Let's add a css rule inside our new `styles.css` file to test it out:

```css
body {
  font-family: "Lucida Grande";
}
```
Save & refresh - cool!

#### Load Order Matters

You may need to include multiple CSS stylesheets in your web page. For example, you might want to load the CSS file of a third-party CSS framework (such as Bootstrap) and include your own custom CSS file as well.

When multiple stylesheets exist, the load order matters if they define the same CSS rule.

To see this in action, let's purposely create a conflict between the external stylesheet (**styles.css**) and both the internal stylesheet and inline styling...

Update **styles.css** as follows:

```css
/* styles.css (external stylesheet) */

body {
  font-family: "Lucida Grande";
  background-color: red;  /* conflicts with earlier inline-styling */
}

h1 {
  text-align: right;  /* conflicts with the internal stylesheet */
}
```

Refresh the page, note your observations and let's do a quick review...

#### Review Questions

**1. When there's a conflict between an internal and/or external stylesheets conflict, who wins?**

**2. Who wins between stylesheets and inline styling?**

**3. What are the three approaches used to add styles to a HTML document?**

**4. Which method is considered a best practice and why?** 

### 4. CSS Selectors

As shown earlier, the **CSS Selector** portion of a CSS rule, targets an element, or elements, to be styled by CSS _property:value_ declarations.

#### Setup

To practice with CSS selectors, copy & paste this additional HTML inside of the `<body>` below our existing `<h1>`:

```html
  <p>This is a paragraph element</p>

  <div>This is a DIV</div>
  <div class="crazy">This is another DIV</div>
  <div class="crazy super-cool">
  	<p>This is a paragraph inside of the third DIV</p>
  </div>

  <p id="comments-title">Comments</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Comment One</li>
    <li class="super-cool">Comment Two</li>
    <li>Comment Three</li>
  </ul>
```

Next, **clean up our styling by deleting the internal stylesheet (`<style>` element) and inline style attribute on the `<body>`**.

Lastly, let's **update `styles.css` to start with the following**:

```css
body {
  font-family: "Lucida Grande";
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
}
```

Now let's investigate the different types of CSS selectors...


#### Basic Selectors

##### *element* Selector

This is how we could select all `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags:

```css
h1, h2 { ... }
```

**PRACTICE:<br>- Set the margin on the `<body>` element to 15 pixels on all four sides<br>- Set the text color of all `<div>` elements to blue.**

##### *ID* Selector

We select an element that matches the value of an `id` attribute by prefixing it with `#`:

```css
#id-name { ... }
```

> Note: **id**'s on elements should always be unique.

**PRACTICE:<br>- Set the size of the font to 28px on the element with an `id="comments-title"`**

##### *class* Selector

Selects elements that match one of the values within the *class* attribute - yes, the *class* attribute accepts multiple space separated values!

To target elements with a given class, or classes, we prefix the name of the class with a period:

```css
.my-class { ... }  /* Target all elements having the class of "my-class" */
span.my-class { ... }  /* Target all <span class="my-class"> elements */
li.item.special { ... }  /* Target all <li class="item special"> elements */
```

**PRACTICE:<br>- Set the border of the `<li>` with a class of `super-cool` to be solid, 2px in width and red in color.**

##### *attribute* Selector

Selects elements based upon its attributes.

Less common, but handy at times:

```css
[style] { ... }  /* Matches elements that have a 'style' attribute */
a[href="#about"] { ... }  /* Targets anchor tags with an 'href' set to "#about" */
```

#### Combinators

Combinators provide a powerful way to select elements based upon their relationship to other elements.

The most common combinator is the **descendant selector**.

We use the _descendant selector_ to target elements **nested** within another element, regardless of the depth of the nesting.

A _descendant selector_ is defined by using a _space_ character between two other selectors:

```css
/* This will match all <span> tags nested anywhere within an <h3> tag having a class of "sub-title" */
h3.sub-title span { ... }
```

**PRACTICE:<br>- Using a _descendant selector_, set the background color of the `<p>` tag with the text of "This is a paragraph inside of the third DIV" to yellow.**

##### There are three additional combinators:

These are not quite as common but can come in handy...

- The **child selector** (`>`)

	The _child selector_ is similar to the _descendant selector_, except that it only matches elements that are **direct** children, that is, nested only one-level deep:

	```css
	/* Selects all <p> tags that are direct children of a <div> */
	div > p {...}
	```
	
- The **adjacent sibling selector** (`+`)

	```css
	div + p {...}
	```

   Would select `<p>` tags only if they were preceded **immediately** by a `<div>` at the same level (sibling).

- The **general sibling selector** (`~`)

	Similar to the _adjacent sibling selector_, except that it targets **all** siblings, not just the adjacent one:

	```css
	div.my-class ~ p {...}
	```

	Would target all `<p>` tags that are siblings following a `<div>` with a class of "my-class".

> **KEY POINT:** Note that the **last** component listed in a combination selector determines what is actually targeted!  For example, looking above, only `<p>` elements are selected, not the divs with a class of my-class.

**Questions?**

#### Pseudo-classes

Pseudo-classes let you style elements not just based upon their class, type, id or position in the document, but also their state. For example, whether an `<input type="checkbox">` is checked or not.

Some common pseudo-classes are `:active`, `:disabled`, `:empty`, `:first-child`, `:nth-child`, `:nth-of-type`, `:focus`, `:hover`, and many more!

We can also chain pseudo-classes for extra good fun time!  `li:nth-child(3):hover`

**PRACTICE:<br>- Use the `:hover` pseudo-class to change the cursor to the little hand-pointer when it's over any of the `<li>` elements.<br>- Use the `::first-letter` pseudo-element to set the size of the "C" in "Comments" to be 60px.**

Here's a link to learn more about [pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pseudo-classes) and [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements).

#### Pseudo-elements

Pseudo-elements style specified parts of an element.

Here are some examples:

- `p::first-letter`: Style the first letter of all `<p>` elements
- `p::first-line`: Style the first line of all `<p>` elements
- `::selection`: Style the part of an element that is selected by the user
- `.special::before`: Add content _before_ all elements with a class of `.special`
- `.special::after`: Add content _after_ all elements with a class of `.special`

> So many options - so confusing!  Yes, but always remember that nobody remembers all of this stuff. You will remember what you actually use on the job regularly. From there, google is your best friend.

#### CSS Selectors - Key Takeaways

CSS selectors provide enormous capability and flexibility to target any element(s) for styling!

CSS selectors allow us to target an element, or elements, without having to resort to assigning a bunch of id's.

As a general note, lean toward using classes instead of id's - remember, id's need to be unique.

### 5. Summary

Learning CSS, like much of coding, is a never-ending process and in this lesson, we've done slightly more than scratch the surface.

As you code, you will undoubtably rely on the numerous resources available to you on the Internet. Hopefully, this lesson has provided you with some context to help you better understand the results returned by your web searches.

Lastly, Chrome's DevTools are invaluable in helping debug among other things, CSS.  [Here's a link to Google's docs that discuss inspecting pages and styles](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/iterate/inspect-styles/basics)

### 6. Further Study

#### Specificity

*Specificity* is the means by which a browser decides which CSS rule gets applied when there is a conflict.  For example:

```css
.my-class {
    color: blue;
}

div {
    color: red;
}

<div class="my-class">What color am I?</div>
```

A conflict exists because the `<div>` matches both CSS selector rules.

The selector with the **highest** *Specificity* wins.

The specificity is based upon the following priorities, where _Priority A_ has higher specificity:

| Priority A | Priority B | Priority C | Priority D |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inline Styling | IDs | Classes, Attributes & Pseudo-classes | Elements |

Internally, the browser computes a CSS Specificity as shown here:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/77mRdUh.jpg">

There is an exception to the concept of *specificity* known as the **!important** declaration.  Use of *!important* is not recommended because it can make debugging CSS more difficult than it already is.
