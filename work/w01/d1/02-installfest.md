# SEI Installfest

We'll be installing the following tools.

- Slack
- Homebrew
- Xcode
- VS Code
- Git
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Python
- Django
- Spectacle
- Imgur
- Zoom

## Slack

We will be using slack to communicate throughout the course. You will receive an invite to the relevant channels via e-mail. You can login via the web browser, but downloading / installing the app is highly recommended.

[Download Slack](https://slack.com/downloads)

Remember to drag the Slack app into the Applications folder when you open the downloaded archive.

## Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager that we will use to install various command line tools in our class.

Open up terminal, and paste the following command to install Homebrew. You might be prompted to install XCode Command Line Tools during the install process.

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

If you are prompted to install the XCode CLI, say yes and your homebrew installation will continue.

After the installation process, run the command `brew doctor`. If any warnings or errors are displayed, we will need to resolve them before proceeding with the rest of the install fest.

Lastly, make sure to run `brew update` to make sure you have the latest lists of available software.


## Xcode

We do not use Xcode in class but some other applications that we do use require some Xcode libraries. Normally, all you need is the Xcode CLI which should have already been installed when you installed Homebrew. If it didn't get installed, you can use this command:

```
xcode-select --install
```

If you need to, you can install Xcode through the App Store. (You probably don't need to.) [Link here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)


## Visual Studio Code

Text editors are a personal choice. One of the most popular open source text editors these days, for good reason, is Visual Studio Code.

> Note: VS Code's _keyboard shortcuts_ are different than the shortcuts used by the Sublime or Atom editors. If you already know Sublime's shortcuts and don't want to learn those of VS Code, it's possible to configure VS Code to use Sublime's.

Download and install VS Code from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

**Important**: Be sure that VS Code is in your Mac's `Applications` folder.

#### Add Ability to Launch VS Code by typing `code`

1. Launch VS Code using spotlight (`command + space` - then start typing `vs c` until you see the app, then press enter).
2. Type `shift + command + P` to open the command palette.
3. Start typing `shell command` and when you the<br>`Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH` command - click it!
4. Quit VS Code and Terminal.
5. Relaunch Terminal
6. You should now be able to open a folder to edit by typing `code .`

Check [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) for troubleshooting if you run into issues.

## Git

Git is the version control software we will be using - it's extremely popular.

You should have already installed Git as instructed to complete the pre-work.

If it's not installed, we can use Homebrew to install it:

```
brew install git
```

#### Github

[Github](https://github.com/) provides a way to host Git repos in the cloud.  It enables collaboration and is wildly popular.

You should have already opened a personal Github account, however, you need to have a General Assembly Github Enterprise account as well.  You can get one by signing up here:  [https://git.generalassemb.ly/join](https://git.generalassemb.ly/join)

#### Configuring a Global git ignore

> Note: This is **IMPORTANT**

Everyone should have a global **git ignore** file so that you don’t have to worry about making the appropriate entries in a project’s git ignore.

First, create the file:  `touch ~/.gitignore_global`

Next, configure git to use this file:  `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global`

Finally, lets put some good stuff in there by editing the newly created `.gitignore_global` file using VS Code:

1. `code ~/.gitignore_global` to open the file in VS Code

2. Copy/paste the following:

	```sh
	# This is a list of rules for ignoring files in every Git repositories on your computer.
	# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files

	```

3. Save the file.

#### Avoiding Having to Create A Git Message Every Time a Git Merge Takes Place

By default, git asks for a commit message any time a merge takes place, for example, you'll be running this command quite a bit:  `git pull upstream master`.

To avoid this from happening, we can add a single line to our terminal configuration - this is the line we're going to need to add anywhere inside of the file identified below:

```
export GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT=no
```

**If NOT using ZSH:**

Use VS Code to edit the `~/.bash_profile` file:

```
code ~/.bash_profile
```

**For ZSH users:**

Use VS Code to edit the `~/.zshrc` file:

```
code ~/.zshrc
```

**Regardless of which file you edited, be sure to save it.  You will also need to quit (`command + Q`) terminal and relaunch it for this setting to take effect.**

## Node.js

Node is a JavaScript engine for the backend. We use it to power our web servers and connect to our databases.

```
brew install node
```

#### Can't Install Node Due to Outdated Operating System

If you receive an error regarding that your operating system is no longer supported, your first option is to update your operating system.  Otherwise, install Node by browsing to [its website](https://nodejs.org/en/), then clicking on the green **Current** button.

#### Verifying the Install

Verify the installation afterwards by running:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

The above commands should display versions without any errors. To verify that all the required permissions are set correctly, try to install a package such as the useful _nodemon_ globally:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```

## PostgreSQL

Install the **PostgreSQL** database management system (DBMS) using Homebrew with this command:

```
brew install postgresql
```

If you receive an error regarding that your operating system is no longer supported, skip to the "Can't Install PostgreSQL Due to Outdated Operating System" installation instructions below...

After Postgres is installed run this command:

```
brew services start postgresql
```
 
Followed by this command to test the install by creating a new database named the same as the current system user:
 
```
createdb
```

#### Can't Install PostgreSQL Due to Outdated Operating System

We'll install an older version of PostgreSQL that's compatible with your operating system.  Don't worry, though, the older version will be just as capable...

1. Install the slightly older version:

	```
	brew install postgresql@9.5
	```
	
2. In the output of the install process, there will be the message:

	**If you need to have postgresql@9.5 first in your PATH run:**
	
	The command that follows begins with `echo 'export PATH...`
	
	Copy that entire command and run it.
	
3. Next, run this command:

	```
	brew link --force postgresql@9.5
	```
	
4. Now let's start up the database:

	```
	brew services start postgresql@9.5
	```
	
5. And finally:

	```
	createdb
	```

## Installing MongoDB

Install **MongoDB** using Homebrew using the following commands:

```
brew tap mongodb/brew
```

The above command might take a moment or two to complete.  When finished, install MongoDB with:

```
brew install mongodb-community
```

### Starting the MongoDB Server

You start the Mongo database server with the following command:

```
brew services start mongodb-community
```

The above command also ensures that the MongoDB engine runs after restarting your computer.

More info about installing MongoDB using Homebrew can be found [here](https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew).

## Installing Python 3

> Note: Due to time constraints and for simplicity, we will not be using Python "virtual environments" during SEI.  If you are familiar with using virtual environments, you may continue to use them.  If you decide to continue to develop using Python beyond SEI, your next step would be to learn about using virtual environments.

Brew is also used to install Python 3. (Python 2 is already installed on your Mac.)

Install **Python** using Homebrew with this command: `brew install python`. 

You can test the installation by running `python3 --version`.

Python 3's package manager, `pip3` should have automatically been installed with Python 3.  Test that it was installed by running `pip3 --version`.

## Installing Django

We will use `pip3` to install Django, a robust web framework for Python. We will be installing the latest version (3.x.x):

```
pip3 install Django
```

If you receive a "permissions" error, try this command:

```
pip3 install --user Django
```

## Installing Spectacle

Install [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) for resizing windows.

This free "productivity" tool is invaluable when it comes to minimizing the time spent sizing windows using the mouse.

## Installing Imgur

Create an account on [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/) and install [mac2imgur](https://github.com/mileswd/mac2imgur) to ease uploading screenshots and other images from your computer to your imgur account.

## Zoom

[Download the Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting) and install it.

## Update Your Shell to Show Repo Info

If you've already personalized your shell, be it Bash or Zsh, you'll want to skip this section.

#### Bash

Use VS Code to edit the `~/.bash_profile` file:

```
code ~/.bash_profile
```

Copy and paste the following (it doesn't matter where):

```
parse_git_branch() {
     git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/'
}
export PS1="\u@\h \[\e[32m\]\w \[\e[91m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\e[00m\]$ "
```

Save the file, quit Terminal (`command + Q`), then re-launch Terminal.

#### Zsh

Zsh users should install Oh-My-Zsh found [here](https://ohmyz.sh/).
