# Intro to the Dev Environment

## Learning Objectives

| Students will be able to: |
|---|
| Be more productive by using the keyboard vs. the mouse |
| Use _Spectacle_ to move and size windows via hotkeys |
| Take screenshots and upload images to _imgur.com_ |
| Use the _Terminal_ Command Line Interface (CLI) to navigate and manipulate the filesystem |
| Use the _VS Code_ text editor to open and edit files |

## Being More Productive by using the Keyboard vs. the Mouse

### Launching Apps with Spotlight

- Developers avoid using the mouse whenever possible.

- Developers are more productive when their hands are on the keyboard.

- Open applications using _Spotlight_ instead of the mouse by:
	1. Pressing `cmd+space` to open _Spotlight_
	2. Start typing the name of the app until the app is highlighted
	3. Press `enter` to open the app!

### Switching Between Applications

- Quickly switch between running applications by pressing `cmd+tab`.

- If a minimized applications does not display after tabbing to it with `cmd+tab`:
	1. Continue to hold down `cmd` and release `tab`
	2. Press `option` then release `cmd`

#### Switching Between Instances of an Application

- You can switch between multiple windows of the same application using `cmd` + `back-tick` (the character above the `tab` key).

- Note that it's best to minimize how many windows/applications you have open when developing to make switching between applications quicker and minimize distractions to the job at hand.

## Uploading Screenshots and Images to _imgur.com_

### Why Upload Images?

- Often you will need to share images with others or use them in your applications, notes, readme files, etc.

- Unfortunately, if an image exists only on your computer, you lose the ability to use it anywhere but on your computer.

- The solution is to upload images to a cloud service...

### Imgur

- One of the most popular image hosting services on the Internet is [Imgur](http://imgur.com/).

- Hopefully, you created your free account during Installfest.

- Although you can upload images using Imgur's web interface, but there's a better way...

### mac2imgur

- [mac2imgur](https://github.com/mileswd/mac2imgur) is a simple Mac app that makes uploading images and screenshots to your Imgur account a snap.

- Hopefully you installed _mac2imgur_ during Installfest.

- After installed, launch it, click the <img src="https://i.imgur.com/IRhgj9C.png" /> in your menubar, then select `Imgur/Sign-in`.

	> Note: If you don't sign in, your uploaded images will be uploaded to Imgur's public domain.

- You can now upload images from your computer by clicking the _mac2imgur_ icon in the menubar and selecting `Upload images...`.

- Screenshots can also now be automatically uploaded to Imgur...

### Screenshots

The following keyboard shortcuts can be used to take screenshots of your screen:

- Whole screen: `shift-cmd-3`
- Part of your screen: `shift-cmd-4`
- A certain window: `shift-cmd-4`, then `spacebar` to toggle window mode

💪 Try uploading a screenshot to Imgur.

## Using _Spectacle_ to Position and Size Windows

### What is _Spectacle_?

- _Spectacle_ is a free utility that resizes and snaps into position app windows.

- If you don't see the "spectacles"<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/spcCRQX.png" /><br/>in your menubar, launch _Spectacle_ using _Spotlight_.

- When running, _Spectacle_ will listen to the keyboard for certain key combinations (hotkeys) and will resize/position the active application accordingly...

### _Spectacle_'s Basic Default Hotkeys

- Here are the most popular hotkeys:

	- Make window full-size — `opt + cmd + F`
	- Move to the left half — `opt + cmd + ←`
	- Move to the right half — `opt + cmd + →`
	- Move to the top half — `opt + cmd + ↑`
	- Move to the bottom half — `opt + cmd + ↓`

- Pressing the same hotkey will size the window by thirds!

- You can find more info about Spectacle [here](https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle).

## Using the _Terminal_ Command Line Interface

### What is _Terminal_?

- _Terminal_ is the developers' choice for entering commands and navigating the filesystem.

- _Terminal_ is an app known as a _shell_.  The default shell in Mac OS X prior to Catalina has been _Bash_ and is now _ZSH_. You will find the terms _terminal_ and _bash_ often used interchangeably.

- Go ahead and open _Terminal_ (remember to use Spotlight!).

### Command Line Basics

Here are the basic command tasks we'll try out:

- Change directories (folders)
- List a directory's contents
- Create a directory
- Create a file
- Move files and directories
- Copy files and directories
- Rename files and directories
- Delete files & directories
- Command history & clearing the window

#### Change Directories

- We use the `cd` command to change directories.

- Let's change to the _home_ directory of the logged in user:

	```sh
	$ cd ~
	```

- Here are a few common shortcut characters used when navigating the filesystem:
	- `~` The logged in user's _home_ directory
	- `/` The _root_ (top-level) directory on the harddrive
	- `.` The current directory
	- `..` The parent directory of the current directory

	> Note:  Paths that begin with `/` or `~` are known as "absolute" paths and work regardless of which current directory you are in.

- The `pwd` command "prints" the current (working) directory

#### List a Directory's Contents

- Use the `ls` command to display a concise list.

- `ls` does not display hidden files by default, adding the `-a` option will show them.

- `tree` is a nice utility for displaying a graphical representation of a directory and its nested directories.<br/>Install it by typing `brew install tree`.

#### Create a Directory

- Use the `mkdir` command to create directories.

- Let's create a `drawers` directory inside of the _home_ directory:

	```sh
	$ mkdir ~/drawers
	```

- Note that you don't have to specify the _full path_ if we are already in the _home_ directory.

#### Using Tab Auto-Completion

- Change to the _home_ directory.

- Now let's change to our newly created `drawers` directory, however, only type `cd d`,<br/>then press `tab` which will auto-complete directory name(s).

- You can cycle between matching directory names by continuing to press `tab`.

#### Creating Files

- We use the `touch` command to create empty files.

- Let's move to the `drawers` directory and create a directory named `socks`. Here is how we can create the directory **and** change to it using a single command:
	
	```sh
	$ mkdir socks && cd socks
	```

- Now let's create a `dress.socks` file:

	```sh
	$ touch dress.socks
	```

#### 💪 Practice Creating Directories and Files

1. Create this directory: `~/drawers/pjs`.

2. Create two files in the new `pjs` folder named `warm.pjs` and `favorite.socks`.

#### Moving Files

- Okay, so we have a messy `drawers/pjs`, let's move our `favorite.socks` file out of the `pjs` folder and into the `drawers/socks` folder where it belongs!

- Here's how we can do the move regardless of which directory we're currently in by using absolute paths:

	```sh
	$ mv ~/drawers/pjs/favorite.socks ~/drawers/socks/
	```
	Be sure to use tab-completion!

> Note that you have the option to use _absolute_ and/or _relative_ paths.

#### Moving Directories

- Moving directories is just as easy using the same `mv` command.

- 💪 Try it out:
	1. Create a `~/shorts` directory
	2. Move the newly created `shorts` directory into the `drawers` directory

#### Renaming Files

- Guess what - there's no dedicated bash command to rename files and directories!

- Don't panic!  The `mv` command is very flexible!

- Here's how we can rename the `warm.pjs` file to `summer.pjs` from anywhere:
	
	```sh
	$ mv ~/drawers/pjs/warm.pjs ~/drawers/pjs/summer.pjs
	```
- Of course, you can actually move and rename simultaneously!

#### Deleting Files

- There's a `rmdir`, but it can't be used to delete non-empty directories, making it useless in most cases.

- However, we can also use the `rm` command to delete both files and directories.

- Let's first use it to delete the `dress.socks` file. Here's one way:
	
	```sh
	$ cd ~/drawers/socks && rm dress.socks
	```

- Using the `*` wildcard character, it's possible to delete and move multiple files. For example, typing `*.socks` would match all files with an extension of `.socks`...

#### Deleting Directories

- Deleting directories is almost the same as deleting files except you must use the `-rf` option, which runs the `rm` command "recursively" and "forces" the deletion of directories.

- To delete the `pjs` folder we could use this command:

	```sh
	$ rm -rf ~/drawers/pjs
	```

#### Moving Multiple Files

- To demonstrate moving multiple files, re-create the `dress.socks` file we just deleted from the `socks` directory.

- Now let's move all of the `.socks` files out of the `socks` folder into our _home_ folder. The following command assumes we're inside the `socks` folder:

	```sh
	$ mv *.socks ~
	```

- Now, without changing directories, return the socks files back to where they belong.

#### Copying Files & Directories

- Use the `cp` command to copy files and directories.

- Here's an example of how to copy all **.js** files:

	```sh
	$ cp *.js ~/dest-folder
	```

- And entire directories by adding the `-R` option:

	```sh
	$ cp -R ./sample-code ~/dest-folder
	```

#### Command History & Clearing the Window

- Pressing the up and down arrows in Terminal will cycle through previously entered commands.  This can be a huge time saver!

- If you'd like to clear the Terminal window, simply press `cmd+k`.

## Using _VS Code_ to Open and Edit Files

### What is _VS Code_?

- _VS Code_ is a popular open-source text-editor maintained by Microsoft.

- It's very customizable and capable.

- VS Code's functionality can be extended using _extensions_, however, most useful features are built-in.

- To try it out, let's use VS Code to open and edit a file...

### Launch _VS Code_ via the `code` Command

- We want to be able to type in `code .` in Terminal and have VS Code open the current directory for editing.

- First, open VS Code's **Command Palette** by pressing `⇧⌘P`.

- Next, type "shell command" and select the `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH` command.

- Restart Terminal for the new $PATH to take effect.

> For the above to work, VS Code must be installed in the **Applications** folder

### Edit a File in VS Code

- To edit a specific file in VS Code, we can simply type the file after `code`.

- Let's add an _alias_ (shortcut) command that will change to your class repo directory by simply typing `repo`.  We can do this by editing the hidden `.bash_profile` (if using **bash**) or `.zprofile` (if using **zsh**) file.

	```sh
	$ code ~/.bash_profile
	        -OR-
	$ code ~/.zprofile
	```

- Now add this line (preferably near other aliases)

	```sh
	alias repo='cd ~/code/<path to repo folder>'
	```

- Pressing `cmd-s` will save the file.

- Close Terminal then re-open it and type `repo` to test it out.

## Going Forward

- Today, we have only scratched the surface of tools such as _Terminal_ and _VS Code_.

- Rest assured that throughout your time in SEI, we will help you to get to know these tools much better!
