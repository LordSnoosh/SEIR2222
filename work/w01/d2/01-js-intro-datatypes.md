## 1. What are Computer Applications?

Before we dive into any particular programming language, we should first consider what programming languages are used for - developing applications.

We develop computer applications/programs to solve problems and/or provide services to us.

Generally, applications manipulate and display data.

When we program, we're concerned about the application's:

- Data
- Input/Output
- Program Statements (Code)

The popularity of JavaScript can be attributed to the growth of web-based applications since it is the only language included in web browsers.

> NOTE: The WebAssembly specification allows the browser to execute code from other languages such as C & C++, however, JavaScript is still required for WebAssembly to work. In other words, WebAssembly does not replace JavaScript.

#### JavaScript's Role

The primary responsibility of JavaScript is to allow developers to implement behavior in web applications via client-side script that runs in the browser.

> The popularity of a technology known as _Node.js_ has made JavaScript popular outside the browser as well.  We'll learn about _Node.js_ in the next unit.

#### A Few Facts About JavaScript:

- Created in 10 days in 1995 by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich).
- Not to be confused with Java (although both have syntaxes based upon the "C" programming language).
- JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript, a standard maintained by the European Computer Manufacturers Association).
- Modern browsers have fully implemented version ES2015 (formerly named ES6). [This website](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) reports the implementation status in all major browsers. ES2015 was a major update that added numerous new features which we'll cover in SEI.

#### Setup

We are going to use Chrome's DevTools in this lesson to inspect and manipulate data.

Open Chrome and press `command + option + j` to open the _console_ (one feature of Chrome's DevTools). The _console_ allows us to enter JS expressions and statements.

## 3. Variables

#### Purpose

The purpose of a **variable** in computer programming is to hold or reference data.

Variables are a way to name a "slot" in computer memory that holds data.

#### `var`, `let` or `const`?

Variables are declared using the `var`, `let` or `const` keywords.

Until ES2015 came along, `var` was our only option and has been for the past 25+ years - so obviously, it does the trick!

Why was `let` and `const` added to the language then?

##### Scope

The difference between `var` and `let`/`const` is what we call _scope_. We're going to cover scope tomorrow, but basically, scope revolves around the accessibility of variables & functions at a given point in the code.

`var` has _function scope_ (also known as _local scope_), for example:

```js
// A single top-level (not within a function) "Global" scope exists 
var result = 100;

function add(n1, n2) {
  var result = n1 + n2;
  return result;
}

function subtract(n1, n2) {
  var result = n1 - n2;
  return result;
}

console.log( add(10, 5) )  //=> 15
console.log( sub(10, 5) )  //=> 5
console.log( result )  //=> 100
```

Note that each `result` variable is an independent variable.


Now, let's take a look at `let`/`const` which have more limited _block scope_.  In computer programming, it's considered a better practice to limit a variables scope (access) which reduces the chance of accidentally changing a variable's value.

In JS, we define a _block_ using curly braces, thus the above code example would behave identically if `let` or `const` were used instead of `var` because the functions' curly braces define a block.

In the following code example:

```js
const msg = "I'm in global scope";

function getMsg(emotion) {
  let msg = 'No emotion';
  if (emotion === 'happy') {
    let msg = 'Happy message';
  } else if (emotion === 'sad') {
    let msg = 'Sad message';
  }
  return msg;
}
```

Testing out the above will show that `'No emotion'` will always be returned because there are 3 separate `msg` variables defined in 3 separate blocks.

However, if `var` was used instead of `let`, there would only be a single `msg` variable which would change the behavior of the function.

##### `let` vs. `const`

The difference between `let` and `const` is that a `const` variable cannot be re-assigned to - you can assign data to it once, and that's it:

```js
let x = 25;
x = 100;  // no problem

const z = 25;
z = 100;  // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

As we'll learn later,  objects (or an object sub-type like array, function, etc.) is a reference type.

Objects are reference types because, if we assign an object to a variable, that variable does not actually hold the object, rather it holds a "reference" that points to the object in memory.  As such, when you assign an object to a `const`, you **can** make changes to the object itself, you just can't re-assign to the `const`:

```js
const person = {name: 'Fred'};
person.age = 25;  // no error
person = {name: 'Barney'}  // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

#### Identifiers & Defining Variables

_Identifiers_ are used to name variables, as well as named functions:

```js
let points;  // the identifier is "points" and names the variable "points"
```

We can also assign a value to a variable at the time we declare it by using the `=` (assignment) operator:

```js
let name = "Fred Flintstone";  // two birds with one stone!
```

and change it's value later...

```js
name = "Barney";  // note that we only declare a variable once
```

Multiple variables can be defined in a single statement, separated by commas:

```js
let name = 'Wilma', age, town = 'Bedrock';

// above is equivalent to
let name = 'Wilma';
let age;
let town = 'Bedrock';
```

##### Identifier Naming Rules

In JavaScript, when naming variables, the convention is to name the identifiers using lowerCamelCase, e.g.,  `numActivePlayers`.

Identifiers in JS:

- Are case-sensitive!
- Cannot begin with a number
- Can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs

❓ **Is `car-3` a valid variable identifier?**

**Any questions regarding variables?**

## 4. Explore JavaScript's Data Types


#### Dynamic vs. Static Typed Languages

Dynamically-typed languages such as JavaScript, Python and Ruby allows variables to be assigned different types of data during runtime (as the program executes).

For example, in JavaScript we can do this:

```js
// Declare variable named data and initialize with a number
let data = 123;

// Reassigning a different type of data is allowed
data = 'Hello';

```

However, statically-typed languages such as Java and C++ require a variable's type to be declared in advance and it cannot be changed:

```c++
// Declare variable as an integer and initialize
int data = 123;

// Assigning anything other than an integer raises an error
data = "Hello";  // NOT ALLOWED
```

> There is a newer language called _TypeScript_ you might hear about - this language is a superset of JS and adds strong typing to JS.  Many developers agree that strong typing makes code less error prone and is worth the extra effort to code in.

#### Exploring JavaScript's Data Types

JavaScript has seven main data types:

- Six primitive data types which represent a **single** value
- and an Object (reference) type that can contain any number of primitive values and/or other objects.

Note that an object can be one of JavaScript's [built-in object sub-types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects) such as:

- Array
- Function (yes, functions are objects in JavaScript!)
- RegExp
- Date
- Error
- BigInt

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/02XLHjQ.png">

> **KEY POINT: If a variable does not hold one of the six primitive values, it is an object!**
 
Okay, let's briefly go through the data types...

#### string

A **string** represents textual data with zero or more characters wrapped by single or double quotation marks such as `"John"` or `'Jane'`. A pair of quotes with nothing between them is still a **string** - an _empty string_.

```
> 'Hello World'
< "Hello World"
> typeof "I'm a string"
< "string"
```

Note that the `typeof` operator itself always returns a string describing the data type.

> ES2015 Note: In addition to using single and double quotes to delimit a string, ES2015 adds a third way by using the back-tick character to create what's called a _template literal_.  We'll learn more about _template literals_ real soon.

#### number

A **number** represents a numeric value.

Unlike many other programming languages, there is no distinction between integer (`15`, `3`, etc.) and floating-point/decimal types (`17.24`, `3.1416`, etc.).

Internally, JS represents all numbers as floating-point values.

```
> 15
< 15
> typeof 15
< "number"
> typeof 12.34
< "number"
> typeof '12.34'  // what will this return as the type?  
```

#### boolean

Whereas strings and numbers can have a virtually unlimited number of different values, the **boolean** data type only has two possible values: `true` and `false`.

#### 💪 EXERCISE: Data Type Examples

**Strings**, **numbers** and **booleans** are the most common data types used to "model" real-world data in applications.

For example, in a Social Gaming app, we would represent a Gamer's Handle using a **string**.

Before moving on to review the other data types, let's pair up with a partner and identify a couple of examples for each of the three common data types that would be used to represent information in that gaming app:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr><th>Application</th><th>Data Type</th><th>Example Data/Information</th></tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td rowspan="3">Social Gaming App</td><td>String</td><td>Gamer's Handle, ?</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Number</td><td>?, ?</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Boolean</td><td>?, ?</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

```
Please *reply* to this slack message with your examples of:
Strings:
Numbers:
Booleans:
```

<hr>

Now let's continue by looking at the other data types...

#### null

The _null_ data type has only one value: `null`.

We often assign the value _null_ to a variable to represent the fact that it has no "real" value 😊

```
> typeof null
< "object"  // Fail! Remember, JS was written in 10 days by one dude!
> var winner = null;
> winner === null
< true
```

#### undefined

A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type `undefined`.  For example:

```js
let cohort;  // cohort currently holds undefined
```

In addition, a function by default returns `undefined` if a value was not explicitly returned using the `return` keyword.

Lastly, you will see `undefined` a lot in the console when it evaluates a statement that does not return a value.

```
> typeof undefined
< "undefined"
> console.log('hello')
  "hello"
< undefined
```

#### symbol

The _symbol_ data type was added with ES2015 and is primarily used to create uniquely named and less visible properties on objects.

Their use is rare in general JavaScript programming.

#### object

The six data types that we've looked at thus far are classified as **_primitive_/_value_** data types because they hold only a **single value**.

Most programming languages also have **complex/reference** data types designed to hold more complex data structures.

JavaScript only has one **reference** type - the **object**.

Objects are collections of zero or more key:value pairs known as properties.

We will learn more about _objects_ in a later lesson.

For now, let's just verify what `typeof` returns:

```
> typeof {course: 'SEI', cohort: 99}
< "object"
> typeof []
< "object"
> typeof /./
< "object"
```

Although _functions_ are also considered objects (_callable objects_ to be exact), the `typeof` operator returns a more helpful data type:

```
> typeof function(){}
< "function"
```

Yay, we've covered all six data types!

## 5. Review Questions

1) **Do all variables have a data type?**

2) **Is `var _save = '';` a valid statement?**

3) **If a variable is not a string, number, boolean, null, undefined or a symbol, it must be an __________.**

## 6. Further Study

### Type Conversion

JavaScript is very relaxed when it comes to data types. Contrary to non-dynamic languages, a variable can change its type.

```js
let m = 15;  // I'm a number
m = 'hey';   // Now I'm a string!
```

#### Beware of Implicit Conversion

JavaScript is friendly and tries to help us whenever it can. However, we all know that sometimes it's better to be left alone.

__Try adding a string to a number.  What did JS do?__

__Now try comparing a number and a string containing the same digits using the equality (`==`) comparison operator__

```js
13 == "13"  // returns true!
```

This is why, unless there's a reason not to do so, we use the _strict equality operator_ (`===`) as it will not perform type conversion. 

#### Explicit Type Conversion

We can easily convert a number to a string using the `toString()` and `toFixed()` methods:

```js
let n = 123.456;
let s1 = n.toString();  // "123.456"
let s2 = n.toFixed(2);  // "123.46"
```

There are a couple of handy methods used to convert strings to numbers: `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()`

```js
let s = "1234.567";
let n1 = parseInt(s);  // 1234
let n2 = parseFloat(s);  // 1234.456
```
Remember however, that the data type for both flavors, integer and float (short for floating-point), is _number_.
