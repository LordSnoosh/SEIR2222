# React Dev Skills Lab - Part 3

## Intro

This lab will simply ask you to use the `useState` hook to add state to the React Dev Skills app.

Updating that state will be an exercise in part 4.

##### This lab, combined with Parts 1, 2 & 4 is a Deliverable

## Exercises

1. Open your "react-dev-skills" sandbox that you created in Part 1.

2. Use the `useState` hook to add a state value named `skills`.

3. Be sure to name the setter function according to the convention discussed in the lesson.

4. Initialize the state using the same array of skill objects used in part 2.

5. When finished, the skills should continue to be displayed without error:
