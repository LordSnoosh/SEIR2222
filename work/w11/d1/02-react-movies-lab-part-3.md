# React Movies - Part 3

## Intro

For this lab, you will continue working in your existing `react-movies` project on CodeSandbox.

Part 3 of the lab will focus on the Actor Index Page.

Here is a link to an example of the final product, but do your best to style the page to your liking!

[React Movies Demo](https://7umcq.csb.app/)


## Exercises

1. Using the imported `movies` array, render a list of all the actors from each movie on your Actor Index Page.
	- Be aware that certain actors appear in multiple movies, but there should be **NO DUPLICATES** on this list
	- Each actor should be rendered as a `ActorCard` component that displays the actors name with some sort of background image
	- The background image you use is up to you
	
#### Bonus

1. Create an Actor Detail Page that shows the list of movies that the actor appeared in!

**Remember that the styling is up to you, but if you need a point of reference check out the [demo](https://7umcq.csb.app/)!**
