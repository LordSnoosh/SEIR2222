## Intro

Time for some practice laying out elements using Flexbox and CSS Grid!

This lab is a **DELIVERABLE**.

## Exercise

- Choose either the vertical or horizontal "profile card" above to reproduce using HTML and CSS.

- Use a combination of Flexbox and CSS Grid to layout the individual elements as close as possible - it does not have to be perfect!

## Setup

- Create an HTML/CSS/JS repl
- Name the repl "Flexbox/Grid Lab"

## Hints

- Be sure to start with a bit of CSS reset:

	```css
		* {
		  box-sizing: border-box;
		}
		
		body {
		  margin: 0;
		  font-family: Helvetica;
		}
	```

- Use the _Digital Color Meter_ application that comes with the Mac to "pick" the colors from the screen.

- Elements can be made to appear circular by using `border-radius: 50%;`.

- For the rating scale with the stars, feel free to use this image tag:

	```html
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iUpkmhs.png">
	```
	
- You can ignore the "phone" & "conversation" icons, just set the background colors of the "box".

## Bonus

As a bonus, reproduce both the vertical and horizontal versions!

## Deliverable
