# JavaScript Callbacks Lab

## Introduction

This lab provides an opportunity to practice working with callbacks.

This lab is **not a deliverable**.


> **Note:** This can be a pair programming activity or done independently.

## Exercise

### Setup

1. Copy each of the exercises to a HTML/CSS/JS Repl in repl.it
3. Code away!

### Exercises

```js
// Exercise 1

// A fellow student shows you this code.  When he runs it, he expects it to
// wait three seconds, then write "Ding!" to the console.  Instead, it writes
// "Ding!" immediately.  Find the bug and fix it.

function writeDing() {
  console.log('Ding!');
}

let timerId = setTimeout(writeDing(), 3000);
```

```js
// Exercise 2

// Javascript arrays have a built-in sort method that can take
// a callback to tell it how to compare the things you want to sort.

// Research the array sort method.

// Write the sorting callback as a named function declaration

// Write the callback function to provide to the sort method so that
// the following code sorts the words from shortest to longest.

const words = ['short', 'medium', 'delicious', 'nice', 'lengthy'];

// The sort method sorts "in place", that is, it modifies the array
words.sort(/* pass in a named callback here */);

// Check that logging words now outputs
// ["nice", "short", "medium", "lengthy", "delicious"]
```

```js
// Exercise 3
//
// Filter the words array from above to create a new array
// named longWords that includes only the words with 7 or more
// characters

const longWords = words.filter(/* write an anonymous inline function here */);

// Check that logging longWords outputs
// ["lengthy", "delicious"]
```

```js
// Exercise 4

// Code a forEach method:
// 		1. Write a function named forEach.
//		2. The forEach function accepts two args, an array & a callback.
//		3. Code the forEach method such that it iterates over each element in the array arg (use a for loop).
//		4. For each iteration, invoke the callback arg, passing to it, the element and the index of the element.

// Test with this array
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'purple'];
// and this callback
function log(elem, idx) {
  console.log(`Index: ${idx} / Element Value: ${elem}`);
}

// calling forEach(colors, log) should resulting in this output:
// Index: 0 / Element Value: red
// Index: 1 / Element Value: green
// Index: 2 / Element Value: blue
// Index: 3 / Element Value: purple
```

```js
// Exercise 5

function step1(cb) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('STEP 1 COMPLETE');
    cb()
  }, 750);
}

function step2(cb) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('STEP 2 COMPLETE');
    cb()
  }, 500);
}
	
function step3(cb) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('STEP 3 COMPLETE');
    cb()
  }, 250);
}

/*
The above functions are working asynchronous functions - DO NOT
change any of their code. They are what we call "black boxes"
because we do not need to know anything that goes on inside of them.

Each of the three functions accept a single argument - a callback function.

Write the code that invokes the three functions such that the output in the console will be:

STEP 1 COMPLETE
STEP 2 COMPLETE
STEP 3 COMPLETE
FINISHED

Hints: 
- Call `step1` first.
- You cannot call `step2` until after `step1` has "finished", similarly, you cannot call `step3` until `step2` has "finished".
- You must console.log the last line of the output, `FINISHED`, after `step3` has "finished".
*/
```

### Bonus

Write function named `countdown` that accepts as an arg the starting number of seconds and console.logs the count down to zero one second apart from each other.

For example:

`countdown(3);`

console.logs something like the following:

```
Count: 3
Count: 2
Count: 1
Count: 0
```
