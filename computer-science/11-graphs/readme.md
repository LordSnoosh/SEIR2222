# Graphs

## Overview
In this lesson, we cover the basics of the node-based data structures known as graphs.

There are two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Graphs](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/403)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing a Graph](exercises/Graph.js)

> The myGA module contains a link to an exercise in CodePen. **The code in CodePen is the exact same as the code in the in-class exercises.** Try out the exercise in CodePen and see how far you can get with it. Stop when you get stuck and we'll review the solution in class.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Define a graph and the difference between undirected and directed graphs. 
- Identify how graphs are used in programming. 
- Implement a graph.

## Prerequisites
- Big O Notation
- Linked lists
- Binary trees

## Duration
1.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class

## Additional Resources
* Some graph data structure [interview question topics](https://medium.com/@codingfreak/graph-data-structure-interview-questions-and-practice-problems-22d5cd488855).
* Visualizations of [breadth-first search](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BFS.html) and [depth-first search](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/DFS.html) in a graph structure.
* [Common interview questions](https://stackabuse.com/graph-data-structure-interview-questions) about graphs that donâ€™t necessarily deal with coding.
