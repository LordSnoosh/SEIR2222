# Stacks and Queues

## Overview
Peanut butter and jelly, Batman and Robin, Rick and Morty... stacks and queues are another iconic duo.

There are two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Stacks and Queues](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/803)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Bracket Matching](exercises/stacksAndQueues.js)


## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Distinguish between a stack and a queue.
- Determine situations in which you’d use a stack or queue over another data structure.
- Build a stack and a queue using a linked list or an array.

## Prerequisites
* Big O notation

## Duration
1.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class

## Additional Resources
* Here are visualizations for the two implementations of stacks: the [array implementation](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/StackArray.html) and [linked list implementation](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/StackLL.html).
* Same thing for queues: the [array implementation](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/QueueArray.html) and [linked list implementation](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/QueueLL.html).
* Common interview questions about [stacks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure) and [queues](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure).
* Don’t forget to review [priority queues](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-set-1-introduction) and [deques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deque-set-1-introduction-applications).
