# Linked Lists

Linked lists are a foundational data structure that many other, more complex structures use as their basis. 

There are two components to this lesson:
1. myGA module: [Linked Lists](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/397)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing a Linked List](exercises/LinkedList.js)

> The myGA module contains a link to an exercise in CodePen. **The code in CodePen is the exact same as the code in the in-class exercises.** Try out the exercise in CodePen and see how far you can get with it. Leave off where you get stuck and we'll review the solution in class.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Define a linked list.
- Explain how a node stores data. 
- Identify situations where you use a linked list instead of an array.
- Build a singly linked list.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation

## Duration
1.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class

## Additional Resources
- The top 20 [linked list interview questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-linked-list-interview-question/) (that's a LOT!).
- Visualize [building a linked list](https://visualgo.net/bn/list).
- Learn more about [doubly linked lists](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/doubly-linked-list) (we only cover a singly linked list in the exercise).
