# Topic Overview: Data Structures
Data Structures features seven lessons that cover foundational data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, sets, binary trees, AVL trees, tries, and graphs.

> **Remember**: A lesson consists of myGA module(s) to introduce the concept and in-class exercise(s) to implement the concept as needed.

We estimate that this topic will take about 11.5 hours to complete. Here's how that breaks down across myGA and in-class time:

| Modality | # of Modules | Estimated time |
|---|---|---|
| myGA | 9 | 4.5 hours |
| In class | 7 | 7 hours |

## Materials Available

Each lesson listed below has its own folder that contains:
* A **student-facing README** that outlines what's covered in the lesson.
* A **student-facing Exercises folder** with instructions, exercise files, and test scripts.
* **Instructor-only materials** in the Solutions and Instructor Guide folder, including solution code and teaching tips.

Each lesson folder also provides additional resources (e.g., reading materials, videos, additional practice opportunities) for you and your students.

> **Note**: The Introduction to Data Structures lesson does not have a folder, as it's just one myGA module. You can check out that module [here](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/878?from=dashboard).

## Lesson Breakdown

There are seven Data Structures lessons. The only substantive lesson that's Tier 1 is Linked Lists, as linked lists are referenced in many of the other lessons. (Stacks and Queues is listed as Tier 2 but is referenced in later lessons, so we recommend having students take the myGA module at the very least.)

The rest of the data structures are Tiers 2 or 3. What does that mean? If you personally love one data structure more than another, feel free to spend more time with that one. Alternatively, if students are struggling with one data structure, feel free to spend more time on that lesson at the expense of another. (As a reminder, we **do not recommend** sharing tiering information with students.)

Because many topics build on each other, you should plan to teach the lessons in the order outlined below. However, feel free to spend more or less time on a given lesson depending on how it lands with your students.

> **Teaching tip**: We **strongly recommend** that you complete the myGA modules before teaching the concepts, so that you know what students are learning!
