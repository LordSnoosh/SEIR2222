# Search Algorithms

## Overview
In this lesson, you'll learn how the binary search algorithm works to find information efficiently and elegantly.

There are two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Search Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/633)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing Binary Search](exercises/searches.js)

>**Note**: The myGA module contains a link to an exercise in CodePen. **The code in CodePen is the exact same as the code for the in-class exercises.** Try out the exercise in CodePen and see how far you can get with it. Leave off where you get stuck and we'll review the solution in class.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the Big O complexities of brute force and binary search approaches.
- Describe how binary search works.
- Write a binary search algorithm to find a value in an array.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Recursion
* Intro to Sorting Algorithms

## Duration
1.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class
