# Basic Sorts

## Overview
This lesson covers two foundational sorting algorithms: bubble sort and insertion sort.

There are three components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Basic Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/778)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing Bubble Sort](exercises/BubbleSort.js)
3. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing Insertion Sort](exercises/InsertionSort.js)

> **Note**: The myGA module contains a link to an exercise in CodePen. **The code in CodePen is the exact same as the code for the in-class exercises.** Try out the exercise in CodePen and see how far you can get with it. Leave off where you get stuck and we'll review the solution in class.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Describe the time and space complexities of bubble sort and insertion sort.
- Implement bubble sort and insertion sort.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Introduction to Sorting

## Duration
Roughly 2.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 2 hours in class
