# Intro to Sorting Exercise

## Overview
You can breathe easy â€” this exercise requires no coding! 

It's called "My First Sort," and all you need is a partner and a deck of cards. We're going to introduce the concept of sorting algorithms with a fun (well, we think it's fun), hands-on activity.

Make sure that you completed the myGA module for Intro to Sorting Algorithms (link) before completing these exercises.
