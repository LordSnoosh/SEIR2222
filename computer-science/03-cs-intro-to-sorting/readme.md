# Intro to Sorting Algorithms

## Overview
This lesson is an introduction to the concept of sorting in computer science, including sorting methods, stability, and how Big O comes into play for sorting.

There are two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Intro to Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/818)
2. [In-Class Exercise: My First Sort](exercises/MyFirstSort.md)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define the two sorting methods and when youâ€™d use each.
- Identify whether a sort is stable or unstable, and what impact that can have.
- Explain how Big O complexity applies to sorting algorithms.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation

## Duration
1.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class

## Additional Reading
* Review the most common types of sorting-related [interview questions](https://www.techiedelight.com/sorting-interview-questions/).
