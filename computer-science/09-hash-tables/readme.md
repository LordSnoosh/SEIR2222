# Hash Tables

## Overview
The Hash Tables lesson has two related myGA modules. The first module introduces the concept of hash tables through an analogy, in an easy-to-understand way, while the second module gets into more of the technical, nitty-gritty parts of hash tables.

There are three components to this lesson:
1. [myGA Module 1: Introduction to Hash Tables](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/512)
2. [myGA Module 2: Hash Tables Deep Dive](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/761) 
3. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing a Hash Table](exercises/HashTable.js)

> The second myGA module contains a link to an exercise in CodePen. **The code in CodePen is the exact same as the code for the in-class exercises.** Try out the exercise in CodePen and see how far you can get with it. Leave off where you get stuck and we'll review the solution in class.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Define hash functions and hash tables. 
- Articulate the benefits of hash tables as they relate to speed of data access. 
- Define collisions and how to resolve them.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Linked Lists

## Duration
2 hours total:
* 1 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class

## Additional Resources
- Handy visualizations for a [closed addressing hash table](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/OpenHash.html) and an [open addressing hash table](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ClosedHash.html).
- Twenty fun interview questions, all related to [various hashing techniques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-hashing-technique-based-interview-questions/).
