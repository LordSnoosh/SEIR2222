# Sets Exercise

Complete the exercise defined in `Set.js` according to the specifications in the comments. In addition to implementing the structure, you'll also get to try out a few set methods!

> **Note:** The myGA module links out to CodePen for a code challenge for a set. **This exercise is the same as the one here and is meant to help you prepare for the in-class exercise.**
