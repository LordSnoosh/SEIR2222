# Sets

Sets are a simple, nifty little data structure. They're similar to arrays with one key difference: They only hold unique values.

There are two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Sets](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/465)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing a Set](exercises/Set.js)

> The myGA module contains a link to an exercise in CodePen. **The code in CodePen is the exact same as the code in the in-class exercises.** Try out the exercise in CodePen and see how far you can get with it. Leave off where you get stuck and we'll review the solution in class.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Define a set and how itâ€™s used in programming. 
- Distinguish between a set, an array, and a linked list. 
- Implement a set and common methods used in sets.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Linked Lists

## Duration
1.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class

## Additional Resources
- The great [set vs. array debate](https://medium.com/front-end-weekly/es6-set-vs-array-what-and-when-efc055655e1a).
- We talk about sets in JavaScript, but they're also a pretty common object in Python. Read more about how they're used [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sets-in-python/).
