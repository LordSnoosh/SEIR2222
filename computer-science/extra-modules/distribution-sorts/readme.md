# Distribution Sorts

## Overview
This lesson covers two sorting algorithms that use the distribution sort method: bucket sort and radix sort. This is different than the other sorting algorithms we've met so far, which use the comparison sorting method.

There are two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Distribution Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/802)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing Bucket Sort](exercises/BucketSort.js)

> **Note**: The myGA module contains a link to an exercise in CodePen. **The code in CodePen is the exact same as the code for the in-class exercises.** Try out the exercise in CodePen and see how far you can get with it. Leave off where you get stuck and we'll review the solution in class.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain how bucket sort and radix sort work.
- Identify scenarios in which bucket sort and radix sort should be used.
- Describe the time complexity of bucket sort.
- Implement bucket sort.

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
* Intro to Sorting Algorithms
* Basic Sorting Algorithms

## Duration
1.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class

## Additional Resources
- A [nice visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BucketSort.html) of bucket sort.
- A [similar visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RadixSort.html) for radix sort.
- Check out how [radix sort is implemented](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/algorithms/sorting/radix-sort), as we won't cover it in the lesson.
