# Design Patterns Questions

Because it's impossible to code a design pattern on its own, for this in-class exercise, we'll focus on the following discussion questions to explore the concepts of design patterns in more depth.

1. What is an abstract class? Provide an example of an abstract class and several subclasses that might inherit from it.

2. Describe a behavioral pattern that influences how React code is written.

3. What is a Singleton and why might it be helpful?

4. Throughout the program, our projects have gradually involved more and more files of smaller and smaller sizes. What would you call this concept and why would you implement it?
