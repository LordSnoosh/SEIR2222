# Design Patterns

## Overview
This lesson introduces the high-level concept of design patterns and explains three design pattern types:
- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral 

There are two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Design Patterns](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/134)
2. In-Class Exercise: [Design Patterns](https://git.generalassemb.ly/software-engineering-immersive/SEI-Course-Materials/tree/master/6_computer-science-materials/design-patterns/design-patterns/exercises)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Explain why design patterns exist in programming.
- Define creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.
- Identify the implementation of design patterns in programming.

## Prerequisites
