# Recursion

## Overview
This lesson introduces the wonders of recursion.

There are two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Recursion](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/773)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Writing Recursive Functions](exercises/recursion.js)

> **Note**: The myGA module contains a link to an exercise in CodePen. **The code in CodePen is the exact same as the code for the in-class exercises.** Try out the exercise in CodePen and see how far you can get with it. Leave off where you get stuck and we'll review the solution in class.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define recursion. 
- Write the base case and recursive cases of a recursive function. 
- Identify functions that use recursion and explain why itâ€™s used.

## Duration
1.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
