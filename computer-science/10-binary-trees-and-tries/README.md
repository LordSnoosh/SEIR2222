# Binary Trees and Tries

## Overview
This lesson covers three similar, tree-based data structures:
- Binary trees.
- Tries.
- A self-balancing binary tree (aka, an AVL tree).

There are four components to this lesson. We recommend tackling them in the order below:
1. [myGA Module 1: Binary Trees and Tries](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/8)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing a Binary Tree](exercises/binaryTree.js)
3. [myGA Module 2: Balancing a Binary Tree](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/263)
4. [In-Class Exercise: Implementing an AVL Tree](exercises/AVLTree.js)

> The myGA modules contain a link to an exercise in CodePen. **The code in CodePen is the exact same as the code in the in-class exercises.** Try out the exercise in CodePen and see how far you can get with it. Stop when you get stuck and we'll review the solution in class.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Describe how a binary tree is structured and what makes it powerful. 
- Describe how a trie is structured.
- Identify scenarios in which trees are used in programming. 
- Balance a binary tree.

## Prerequisites
* Big O notation
* Recursion

## Duration
3 hours total:
* 1 hour myGA
* 2 hours in class

## Additional Resources
* Since we don't cover how to build a trie, read about how it's implemented in code [here](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/trie).
* Check out these beautiful visualizations: [a binary tree](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html), [a trie](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Trie.html), and [an AVL tree](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html).
* How to distinguish between [several types of tree data structures](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/tree).
* Common [interview questions about binary trees](https://medium.com/@codingfreak/binary-tree-interview-questions-and-practice-problems-439df7e5ea1f).
* Tree balancing interview prep: [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-normal-bst-balanced-bst/) and [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-determine-if-a-binary-tree-is-balanced).
