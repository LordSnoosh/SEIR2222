# Binary Trees and Tries Exercises



## Part 1: Binary Trees and Tries Exercises

After viewing the first myGA module, Binary Trees and Tries, you can complete the exercises in `binaryTree.js`. 

You can automatically test your progress by running `npm install` inside this folder to install the automated testing libraries, then run `npm test` to see if your functions pass the test cases.

> **Note:** The `height()` and `isBalanced()` functions should be considered an optional challenge that prepares you for the second lesson's challenges. 

#### Optional Trie Challenge

The "wordTrie-challenge" folder contains an optional challenge asking you to implement a search trie based on all the words in the English language. This is **optional and advanced**, but if you mastered building a binary tree, you should take on this challenge!

This project folder also contains automated tests that can be run in the same way.

## Part 2: Self-Balancing Binary Tree Exercise

After viewing the second myGA module, Balancing a Binary Tree, you can complete the exercises in `AVLTree.js`. 

These exercises are also **optional and advanced content**.
